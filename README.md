# lite-ai-chat-widget
An embeddable, zero‑dependency AI chat widget you can drop into any website and connect to your n8n, make or zapier (or any HTTP) webhook. It renders a floating chat bubble, optional pre‑chat form, and a simple chat window that posts user messages to your backend and displays replies.
